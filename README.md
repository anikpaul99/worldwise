## Project Overview

WorldWise offers a seamless way for users to document their travels. With a simple login system, users can start adding cities to their visited list. The application leverages a map interface, allowing users to click on a city to record their visit, including the date and personal notes. The side navigation provides quick access to both cities and countries, enhancing the user experience by categorizing visits geographically.

## Features

- **City Registration:** Users can add cities they've visited by clicking on the map. The city name is fetched from an external API, and users can add the date of visit and notes about their trip.
- **Interactive Map:** The map interface allows users to view their current location using the geoLocationAPI. The map updates dynamically as users interact with it.
- **City and Country Lists:** A side navigation bar lists all registered cities and countries, with URL routing between `/app/cities` and `/app/countries`.
- **City Details:** Clicking on a city marker or a city from the list brings up detailed information, including a link to the city's Wikipedia page.
- **Delete City:** Users can delete a city from their list, with a loading spinner indicating the process, as the city data is fetched from a fake API.
